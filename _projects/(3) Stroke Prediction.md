# Stroke Prediction


This project is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke or not. The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). The dataset is imbalanced which posed a challenge to the model. Various ideas were tested to improve the model's performance.
